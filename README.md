Implemented a project in which a house built on grass is lighted dynamically by sunlight.

The sun is modeled by a sphere which is constructed using recursive subdivision of a regular tetrahedron. It moves in a semicircular trajectory above the scene.

The house and grass are constructed using quads and adjusting the material properties of their respective surfaces.

There are options ( menu with right click ) for choosing between: 

a) using flat and smooth shading.

b) closing and opening a spotlight.

c) using 1 or 100 polygons for the ground ( grass ).

The camera can be rotated using left and right keyboard keys.
